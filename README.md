# Threat-Intelligence-Lab
In this project, I analyzed threat actor profiling as a key component of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) to understand attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The project focused on APT41, a known cyber threat group, and the SolarWinds attack, mapping their behaviors using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
### Objective
This lab aims to develop proficiency in Threat Actor Profiling and the MITRE ATT&CK Framework to enhance Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). Analyzing real-world adversaries, such as APT41, to understand their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and investigating notable cyber incidents, such as the SolarWinds attack. Through OSINT tools and security intelligence reports, this lab aims to improve threat detection, incident response, and mitigation strategies, enabling a proactive defense against evolving cyber threats.
### Skills Learned
- Understanding of MITRE ATT&CK concepts and practical applications.
- Ability to identify and analyze adversary motives, behaviors, and attack patterns.
- Ability to map real-world cyber threats to the ATT&CK framework for improved detection and response.
- Proficiency in gathering and analyzing threat data using OSINT tools.
- Enhanced knowledge in cyber attack investigation, identifying IoCs, and proposing mitigation strategies.
- Understanding how MITRE ATT&CK integrates with security standards like NIST and CIS.
### Tools used
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework – For mapping threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- OSINT Tools (VirusTotal, Shodan) – For gathering threat intelligence and identifying Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).
- Threat Intelligence Reports (CrowdStrike, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Report) – For analyzing real-world adversary behaviors and attack patterns.
- Attack Chain Diagram Tools (Lucidchart) – For visualizing attack lifecycles and mapping security gaps.
- Security Frameworks (NIST, CIS) – For aligning threat intelligence with industry best practices.
